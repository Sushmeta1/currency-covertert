# Building a Currency Converter

## Introduction

Agile methodology is a flexible and iterative approach to software development that promotes collaboration, adaptability, and customer satisfaction. One of the most widely used Agile frameworks is Scrum; however, we have chosen Sprint, which helps teams deliver functional software in incremental stages called sprints. This document explains how to apply Agile methodology to efficiently build a currency converter application.

## 1. Defining the Product Vision

The first step in an Agile approach is to establish a clear product vision. The currency converter application should allow users to convert between different currencies in real time, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.

### Key Features

- Selection of source and target currencies
- Fetching real-time exchange rates
- User-friendly interface
- Historical exchange rate data (optional)

## 2. Creating the Product Backlog

The product backlog is a prioritized list of features and tasks required for development.

### Example Backlog Items

- Set up the project environment
- Design the user interface (UI)
- Integrate an API for real-time exchange rates
- Implement currency selection functionality
- Develop conversion logic
- Implement testing and debugging
- Deploy the application

## 3. Sprint Planning

Development is divided into sprints, typically lasting 1-2 weeks. During sprint planning, the team selects a subset of tasks from the backlog to work on in the sprint.

### Example Breakdown for Sprint 1

- Setting up the project environment
- Designing the UI
- Implementing currency selection

## 4. Daily Stand-up Meetings

The team holds brief daily meetings to discuss:

- What was accomplished yesterday?
- What will be worked on today?
- Any blockers or challenges?

## 5. Development & Continuous Feedback

During the sprint, developers work on assigned tasks. Feedback from stakeholders and users is gathered frequently to ensure alignment with expectations.

## 6. Sprint Review & Retrospective

At the end of each sprint:

- **Sprint Review:** The team showcases completed features.
- **Sprint Retrospective:** The team reflects on what went well and what can be improved for future sprints.

## 7. Incremental Delivery

After multiple sprints, a minimum viable product (MVP) is ready. Further iterations continue to enhance the application based on user feedback.

## Conclusion

Applying Agile methodology to develop a currency converter ensures a structured yet flexible workflow. Continuous iterations, stakeholder feedback, and adaptability make Agile an effective approach for delivering high-quality software solutions.
